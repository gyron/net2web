# net2web
PHP client library for Net2Web


## Installation Instructions
### Composer
Via command line simply do:  
```
composer require gyron/net2web
```

Alternatively you can update the `"require": {` section in your `composer.json` with a line reading:
```
"gyron/net2web" : "master"
```
(Note: We have not yet versioned this library and so simply installing directly from master is all that is available for the moment).
